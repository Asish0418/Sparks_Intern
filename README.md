# Sparks_Intern
I completed the first task of the internship, which was the profile building part which reallyhelped me to explore myriad people with different skills and also it helped me to connect with more like minded persons around.

Now this is the second task, the task of our domain!
Application of supervised machine learning.

It's a very interesting data provided here having two variables 'Score' and 'Hours'. We use the data for building a linear regression model from it, used it to predict scores of a person relating to the study hours.
Steps-
a) Create the dataframe, see the data variability and the relation between the numeric variables using summary stats & visualization.
b)Create a linear regression model, predict the scores from the independent variable 'Hours' which denotes the hours of preparation.
c)Predict the model on new data.
d)Check the model's validity or accuracy.

Check the source code in the .R file and the outputs in the word file provided.
