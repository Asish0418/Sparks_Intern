Application of supervised machine learning.

It's a very interesting data provided here having two variables 'Score' and 'Hours'. We use the data for building a linear regression model from it, used it to predict scores of a person relating to the study hours.
Steps-
a) Create the dataframe, see the data variability and the relation between the numeric variables using summary stats & visualization.
b)Create a linear regression model, predict the scores from the independent variable 'Hours' which denotes the hours of preparation.
c)Predict the model on new data.
d)Check the model's validity or accuracy.
